## Team Coordination Notes

### Dependencies Between Teams:
- **Team 1 (Overlay)** needs: Data models (✓), Database (✓), Backend API (Task 3)
- **Team 2 (Insights)** needs: Data models (✓), Database (✓), Backend API (Task 3)  
- **Team 3 (UI/Groups)** needs: Data models (✓), Database (✓)

### Concurrent Work Strategy:
1. **Start immediately**: Teams 2 & 3 can begin their work using mock data
2. **Backend priority**: Complete Task 3 first to unblock Team 1's advice integration
3. **Integration points**: Teams should coordinate on shared interfaces and state management
4. **Testing**: Each team writes unit/widget tests; integration testing happens in final phase

### Communication Interfaces:
- **TimerManager**: Team 1 → Team 3 (timer status updates)
- **UsageStatsService**: Team 2 → Team 1 (usage data for advice context)
- **AdviceService**: Team 1 → Team 2 (for insights AI integration)
- **State Management**: Team 3 → All (app-wide state solution)
